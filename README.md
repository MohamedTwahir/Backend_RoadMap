# 🧠 My Backend Developer Journey 🚀

Welcome to my learning journey toward becoming a **Backend Developer**. This repository serves as my personal logbook, documentation space, and project playground while I progress through a structured 8-step roadmap.

    A[Step 1: Learn About the Web 🌐] --> B[Step 2: Learn Node.js ⚙️]
    B --> C[Step 3: My Ecosystem 🛠️]
    C --> D[Step 4: Hosting & Deployment ☁️]
    D --> E[Step 5: Databases 🗃️]
    E --> F[Step 6: APIs 🔌]
    F --> G[Step 7: API Protocols 📡]
    G --> H[Step 8: Auth & Security 🔐]
🗂️ Step-by-Step Breakdown
✅ Step 1: Learn About the Web 🌐
Understand how the internet works

HTTP/S, browsers, DNS, servers, requests & responses

Learn client-server architecture and ports

🔧 Step 2: Learn Node.js
Intro to Node.js and its use in backend

File system, HTTP module, events, streams

Creating basic servers

⚙️ Step 3: My Ecosystem
Environment variables and secure config management (dotenv, process.env)

Dependency management (npm)

Module bundlers (webpack, esbuild)

Understanding the Node.js runtime

☁️ Step 4: Hosting & Deployment
Research different hosting platforms: Vercel, Netlify, Render, Heroku, Railway, etc.

Learn basics of CI/CD and deployment workflows

Try deploying a basic app

🗃️ Step 5: Databases
Relational (PostgreSQL) vs Non-relational (MongoDB)

Basic CRUD operations

ORMs (Prisma, Mongoose)

Connecting databases to Node.js

🔌 Step 6: APIs
RESTful API design

Creating and consuming APIs

Status codes, error handling, best practices

📡 Step 7: API Protocols
Understanding REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC

Versioning

Rate limiting and throttling

🔐 Step 8: Authentication & Authorization
OAuth 2.0

JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Social login integrations (e.g., Google Login)

Using Google APIs securely

Roles and permissions (RBAC, ABAC)
